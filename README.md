# Predicting-House-Price
This project predicts housing prices using a Linear Regression model. It covers data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²). The results are visualized with a scatter plot comparing actual vs. predicted prices, making it beginner-friendly and easy to follow.
